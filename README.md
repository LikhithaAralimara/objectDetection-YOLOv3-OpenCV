# objectDetection-YOLOv3-OpenCV
This Python script uses OpenCV to implement object detection with the YOLOv3 model, capable of accurately identifying multiple objects in images or video frames. It captures video from the default camera or loads an image, applies real-time detection with user-defined thresholds, and displays results in a window named 'win'.
